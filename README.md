# Matrix-Library
Simple Library for matrix Operations


This is a simple library I wrote in C++ to do matrix operations. To test it out just copy the matrix.h and matrix.cpp files to your project.
You can also open it with Visual Studio 2015 since I used it to write the code and debug it. 


I hope that you will find this code helpful. I do not intent on using this as a primary Matrix Library to do operations since there are better alternatives
but it helps grasp some of the concepts of linear algebra in combination with programming.
